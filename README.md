### SDMM First Application - Digital Clock App

# Considerations
* Number suffix solution isn't scaleable 
* 12/24 switch works, but is fragile and could use improvement. 

# Deliverables
    [X] Project should be in a Git repository on GitHub
    [-] You should make regular (daily) Git commits to the project
    [X] Clock should show current date (eg. Monday, August 12th)
    [X] Clock should show current time in hours, minutes and seconds (HH:MM:SS)
    [X] Upon completion, this web app should be publicly accessible (utilizing GitHub pages hosting)
    [X] BONUS (if completed ahead of time):
        Create a button that toggles the current time between 12/24 hour displays

        [X] HTML
        [X] CSS
